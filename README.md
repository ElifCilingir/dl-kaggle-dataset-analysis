## dl-kaggle-dataset-analysis

### Introduction

This project's goal is to analyse the dataset and apply classification of the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) with different models.
As we progress through the analysis, we will publish our results on this repository. Some of the results we will find might not be totally accurate.

Although we'll try to comment and precise every function and script in our files.
